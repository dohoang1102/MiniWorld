#Mini World#

Little RPG I made for iPhone in a 36 hour gamejam. It uses OpenGL for the awesome graphics, which I drew myself. I made the sound effects, but the music is from somewhere on the interwebs.

Warning: This project contains quickly written probably-bad code. I will not be responsible for any mindblown related to reading this code.
